How To Contribute
=================

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ``argon2-cffi``!
It's people like *you* who make it such a great tool for everyone.

This document intends to make contribution more accessible by codifying tribal knowledge and expectations.
Don't be afraid to open half-finished PRs, and ask questions if something is unclear!


Workflow
--------

- No contribution is too small!
  Please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Try to limit each pull request to *one* change only.
- Since we squash on merge, it's up to you how you handle updates to the master branch.
  Whether you prefer to rebase on master or merge master into your branch, do whatever is more comfortable for you.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
  This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation can't be merged.
- Make sure your changes pass our CI_.
  You won't get any feedback until it's green unless you ask for it.
- Once you've addressed review feedback, make sure to bump the pull request with a short note, so we know you're done.
- Don’t break `backward compatibility`_.


Code
----

- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
  We use the ``"""``\ -on-separate-lines style for docstrings:

  .. code-block:: python

     def func(x):
         """
         Do something.

         :param str x: A very important parameter.

         :rtype: str
         """
- If you add or change public APIs, tag the docstring using ``..  versionadded:: 16.0.0 WHAT`` or ``..  versionchanged:: 16.2.0 WHAT``.
- We use isort_ to sort our imports, and we follow the Black_ code style with a line length of 79 characters.
  As long as you run our full tox suite before committing, or install our pre-commit_ hooks (ideally you'll do both -- see below "Local Development Environment"), you won't have to spend any time on formatting your code at all.
  If you don't, CI will catch it for you -- but that seems like a waste of your time!


Tests
-----

- Write your asserts as ``expected == actual`` to line them up nicely:

  .. code-block:: python

     x = f()

     assert 42 == x.some_attribute
     assert "foo" == x._a_private_attribute

- To run the test suite, all you need is a recent tox_.
  It will ensure the test suite runs with all dependencies against all Python versions just as it will in our CI.
  If you lack some Python versions, you can can always limit the environments like ``tox -e py27,py35`` (in that case you may want to look into pyenv_, which makes it very easy to install many different Python versions in parallel).
- Write `good test docstrings`_.


Documentation
-------------

- Use `semantic newlines`_ in reStructuredText_ files (files ending in ``.rst``):

  .. code-block:: rst

     This is a sentence.
     This is another sentence.

- If you start a new section, add two blank lines before and one blank line after the header, except if two headers follow immediately after each other:

  .. code-block:: rst

     Last line of previous section.


     Header of New Top Section
     -------------------------

     Header of New Section
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     First line of new section.

- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.
  Use `semantic newlines`_, and add a link to your pull request:

  .. code-block:: rst

     - Added ``argon2_cffi.func()`` that does foo.
       It's pretty cool.
       [`#1 <https://github.com/hynek/argon2_cffi/pull/1>`_]
     - ``argon2_cffi.func()`` now doesn't crash the Large Hadron Collider anymore.
       That was a nasty bug!
       [`#2 <https://github.com/hynek/argon2_cffi/pull/2>`_]


Local Development Environment
-----------------------------

You can (and should) run our test suite using tox_.
However, you’ll probably want a more traditional environment as well.
We highly recommend to develop using the latest Python 3 release because ``argon2_cffi`` tries to take advantage of modern features whenever possible.

First create a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/>`_.
It’s out of scope for this document to list all the ways to manage virtual environments in Python, but if you don’t already have a pet way, take some time to look at tools like `pew <https://github.com/berdario/pew>`_, `virtualfish <https://virtualfish.readthedocs.io/>`_, and `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Next, get an up to date checkout of the ``argon2_cffi`` repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:hynek/argon2_cffi.git

or if you want to use git via ``https``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/hynek/argon2_cffi.git

Change into the newly created directory and **after activating your virtual environment** install an editable version of ``argon2_cffi`` along with its tests and docs requirements:

- First you have to make sure, that our git submodules are up to date and the Argon2 extension is built:

  #. ``git submodule init`` (to initialize git submodule mechanics)
  #. ``git submodule update`` (to update the vendored Argon2 C library to the version ``argon2_cffi`` is currently packaging)
  #. ``python setup.py build`` (to build the CFFI module)

  One of the environments requires a system-wide installation of Argon2.
  On macOS, it's available in Homebrew (`brew install argon2`, but you also will have to update your `LDFLAGS` so you compiler finds it) and recent Ubuntus (zesty and later) ship it too.


- Next (re-)install ``argon2_cffi`` along with its developement requirements:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install -e '.[dev]'

****

**Whenever the Argon2 C code changes**: you will have to perform the steps above again except of ``git submodule init``.

****

At this point,

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python -m pytest

should work and pass, as should:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd docs
   $ make html

The built documentation can then be found in ``docs/_build/html/``.

To avoid committing code that violates our style guide, we strongly advise you to install pre-commit_ [#f1]_ hooks:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pre-commit install

You can also run them anytime (as our tox does) using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pre-commit run --all-files


.. [#f1] pre-commit should have been installed into your virtualenv automatically when you ran ``pip install -e '.[dev]'`` above. If pre-commit is missing, it may be that you need to re-run ``pip install -e '.[dev]'``.
