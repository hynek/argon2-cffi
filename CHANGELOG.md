# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [*Keep a Changelog*](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [*Calendar Versioning*](https://calver.org/).

The **first number** of the version is the year.
The **second number** is incremented with each release, starting at 1 for each year.
The **third number** is when we need to start branches for older releases (only for emergencies).

*argon2-cffi* has a very strong backwards-compatibility policy.
Generally speaking, you shouldn't ever be afraid of updating.

Whenever breaking changes are needed, they are:

1.  …announced here in the changelog.
2.  …the old behavior raises a `DeprecationWarning` for a year (if possible).
3.  …are done with another announcement in the changelog.

What explicitly *may* change over time are the default hashing parameters and the behavior of the [CLI interface](https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html).

<!-- changelog follows -->


## [Unreleased](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/21.3.0...HEAD)

### Added

- Official support for Python 3.11.


## [21.3.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/21.2.0...21.3.0) - 2021-12-11

### Fixed

- While the last release added type hints, the fact that it's been missing a `py.typed` file made *Mypy* ignore them.
  [#113](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/113)


## [21.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/21.1.0...21.2.0) - 2021-12-08

### Removed

- Python 3.5 is not supported anymore.

- The *CFFI* bindings have been extracted into a separate project: [*argon2-cffi-bindings*]
  This makes *argon2-cffi* a Python-only project und should make it easier to contribute to and have more frequent releases with high-level features.

  This change is breaking for users who want to use a system-wide installation of *Argon2* instead of our vendored code, because the argument to the ``--no-binary`` argument changed.
  Please refer to the [installation guide](https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).


### Added

- Thanks to lots of work within [*argon2-cffi-bindings*], there're pre-compiled wheels for many new platforms.
  Including:
    - Apple Silicon via `universal2`
    - Linux on `amd64` and `arm64`
    - [*musl libc*](https://musl.libc.org) ([*Alpine* Linux!](https://www.alpinelinux.org)) on `i686`, `amd64`, and `arm64`
    - PyPy 3.8

  We hope to provide wheels for Windows on `arm64` soon, but are waiting for GitHub Actions to support that.

- `argon2.Parameters.from_parameters()` together with the `argon2.profiles` module that offers easy access to the RFC-recommended configuration parameters and then some.
  [#101](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/101)
  [#110](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/110)

- The CLI interface now has a `--profile` option that takes any name from `argon2.profiles`.

- Types!
  *argon2-cffi* is now fully typed.
  [#112](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/112)


### Changed

- `argon2.PasswordHasher` now uses the RFC 9106 low-memory profile by default.
  The old defaults are available as `argon2.profiles.PRE_21_2`.


## [21.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/20.1.0...21.1.0) - 2021-08-29

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [62358ba](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/62358ba2123abd17fccf2a108a301d4b52c01a7c) (20190702)

### Removed

- Microsoft stopped providing the necessary SDKs to ship Python 2.7 wheels and currenly the downloads amount to 0.09%.
  Therefore we have decided that Python 2.7 is not supported anymore.


### Changed

- There are indeed no changes whatsoever to the code of *argon2-cffi*.
  The *Argon2* project also hasn't tagged a new release since July 2019.
  There also don't seem to be any important pending fixes.

  This release is mainly about improving the way binary wheels are built (`abi3` on all platforms).


## [20.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/19.2.0...20.1.0) - 2020-05-11

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [62358ba](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/62358ba2123abd17fccf2a108a301d4b52c01a7c) (20190702)


### Added

- It is now possible to manually override the detection of *SSE2* using the `ARGON2_CFFI_USE_SSE2` environment variable.


## [19.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/18.3.0...19.1.0) - 2019-10-27

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [62358ba](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/62358ba2123abd17fccf2a108a301d4b52c01a7c) (20190702)

### Removed

- Python 3.4 is not supported anymore. It has been unsupported by the Python core team for a while now and its PyPI downloads are negligible.

  It's very unlikely that *argon2-cffi* will break under 3.4 anytime soon, but we don't test it and don't ship binary wheels for it anymore.

### Fixed

- The dependency on `enum34` is now protected using a PEP 508 marker.
  This fixes problems when the sdist is handled by a different interpreter version than the one running it.
  [#48](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/issues/48)


## [19.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/18.3.0...19.1.0) - 2019-01-17

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [670229c](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/670229c849b9fe882583688b74eb7dfdc846f9f6) (20171227)

### Added

- Added support for *Argon2* v1.2 hashes in `argon2.extract_parameters()`.


## [18.3.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/18.2.0...18.3.0) - 2018-08-19

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [670229c](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/670229c849b9fe882583688b74eb7dfdc846f9f6) (20171227)

### Added

- `argon2.PasswordHasher`'s hash type is configurable now.


## [18.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/18.1.0...18.2.0) - 2018-08-19

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [670229c](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/670229c849b9fe882583688b74eb7dfdc846f9f6) (20171227)

### Changed

- The hash type for `argon2.PasswordHasher` is Argon2**id** now.

  This decision has been made based on the recommendations in the latest [*Argon2* RFC draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-04#section-4).
  [#33](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/issues/33)
  [#34](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/34)

- Some of the hash parameters have been made stricter to be closer to said recommendations.
  The current goal for a hash verification times is around 50ms.
  [#41](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/41)

### Added

- To make the change of hash type backward compatible, `argon2.PasswordHasher.verify()` now determines the type of the hash and verifies it accordingly.

- To allow for bespoke decisions about upgrading *Argon2* parameters, it's now possible to extract them from a hash via the `argon2.extract_parameters()` function.
  [#41](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/41)

- Additionally `argon2.PasswordHasher` now has a `check_needs_rehash()` method that allows to verify whether a hash has been created with the instance's parameters or whether it should be rehashed.
  [#41](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/41)


## [18.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/16.3.0...18.1.0) - 2018-01-06

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [670229c](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/670229c849b9fe882583688b74eb7dfdc846f9f6) (20171227)

### Added

- It is now possible to use the *argon2-cffi* bindings against an *Argon2* library that is provided by the system.


## [16.3.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/16.2.0...16.3.0) - 2016-11-10

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [1c4fc41f81f358283755eea88d4ecd05e43b7fd3](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/1c4fc41f81f358283755eea88d4ecd05e43b7fd3) (20161029)

### Added

- Add low-level bindings for Argon2id functions.

### Fixed

- Prevent side-effects like the installation of `cffi` if `setup.py` is called with a command that doesn't require it.
  [#20](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/20)
- Fix a bunch of warnings with new `cffi` versions and Python 3.6.
  [#14](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/14)
  [#16](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/issues/16)


## [16.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/16.1.0...16.2.0) - 2016-09-10

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [4844d2fee15d44cb19296ddf36029326d17c5aa3](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/4844d2fee15d44cb19296ddf36029326d17c5aa3)

### Fixed

- Fixed compilation on debian jessie.
  [#13](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/pull/13)


## [16.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/16.0.0...16.1.0) - 2016-04-19

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [00aaa6604501fade85853a4b2f5695611ff6e7c5](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/00aaa6604501fade85853a4b2f5695611ff6e7c5).

### Added

  - Add `VerifyMismatchError` that is raised if verification fails only because of a password/hash mismatch.
  It's a subclass of `VerificationError` therefore this change is completely backwards-compatible.

### Changed

- Add support for [*Argon2* 1.3](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/beOzPh41Hz3cjl5QD7MSRNTi3lA/).
  Old hashes remain functional but opportunistic rehashing is strongly recommended.

### Removed

- Python 3.3 and 2.6 aren't supported anymore.
  They may work by chance but any support to them has been ceased.

  The last Python 2.6 release was on October 29, 2013 and isn't supported by the CPython core team anymore.
  Major Python packages like Django and Twisted dropped Python 2.6 a while ago already.

  Python 3.3 never had a significant user base and wasn't part of any distribution's LTS release.


## [16.0.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/15.0.1...16.0.0) - 2016-01-02

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [421dafd2a8af5cbb215e16da5953663eb101d139](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/421dafd2a8af5cbb215e16da5953663eb101d139).

### Deprecated

- `hash_password()`, `hash_password_raw()`, and `verify_password()` should not be used anymore.
  For hashing passwords, use the new `argon2.PasswordHasher`.
  If you want to implement your own higher-level abstractions, use the new low-level APIs `hash_secret()`, `hash_secret_raw()`, and `verify_secret()` from the `argon2.low_level` module.
  If you want to go *really* low-level, `core()` is for you.
  The old functions will *not* raise any warnings though and there are *no* immediate plans to remove them.

### Added

- Added `argon2.PasswordHasher`.
  A higher-level class specifically for hashing passwords that also works on Unicode strings.
- Added `argon2.low_level` module with low-level API bindings for building own high-level abstractions.


## [15.0.1](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/15.0.0...15.0.1) - 2015-12-18

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b).

### Fixed

- Fix `long_description` on PyPI.


## [15.0.0](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/compare/15.0.0b5...15.0.0) - 2015-12-18

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b).

### Added

- Conditionally use the [*SSE2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2)-optimized version of `argon2` on x86 architectures.

### Changed

- `verify_password()` doesn't guess the hash type if passed `None` anymore.
  Supporting this resulted in measurable overhead (~0.6ms vs 0.8ms on my notebook) since it had to happen in Python.
  That means that naïve usage of the API would give attackers an edge.
  The new behavior is that it has the same default value as `hash_password()` such that `verify_password(hash_password(b"password"), b"password")` still works.
- Tweaked default parameters to more reasonable values.
  Verification should take between 0.5ms and 1ms on recent-ish hardware.

### Fixed

- More packaging fixes.
  Most notably compilation on Visual Studio 2010 for Python 3.3 and 3.4.


## [15.0.0b5](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi/tree/15.0.0b5) - 2015-12-10

Vendoring *Argon2* @ [4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/tree/4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b).

### Added

- Initial work.
  Previous betas were only for fixing Windows packaging.
  The authors of *Argon2* were kind enough to [help me](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/issues/44) to get it building under Visual Studio 2008 that we’re forced to use for Python 2.7 on Windows.
